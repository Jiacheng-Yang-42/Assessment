Algorithm 4

Top 5 Students with the Highest Total Marks
Start
1.Add the function of user input to view the top five students with the highest total marks in the menu.
2.Add a definition to the student list to view the 5 students with the highest total marks.
3.First, ensure there are at least 5 students. Ensure not to exceed the boundary of the student list.
4.Start from the bottom of the student list.
5.Start the loop. If the student's mark is greater than the previous student's mark, keep it. 
6.In each iteration of the loop, reduce the student list by one until the loop condition is not met.
7..Print the results:
Student name
Student ID
Student total marks
End

Top 5 Students with the Lowest Total Marks
Start
1.Add the user input function to view the top five students with the lowest total marks in the menu.
2.Add a definition to the student list to view the 5 students with the lowest total marks.
3.First, ensure there are at least 5 students. Ensure not to exceed the boundary of the student list.
4.Start from index 0.
5.Start the loop. If the student's mark is less than the previous student's mark, keep it.
6.In each iteration of the loop, increase the student list by one until it exceeds the number of students in the list.
7.Print the results:
Student name
Student ID
Student total marks
