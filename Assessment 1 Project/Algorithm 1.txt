Algorithm findHighestScore(scores)
Assuming the first score is the highest score.
Scores will be iterated
If in each iteration, the current score is greater than the previous one, then the current score is the highest Score.
Output print Highest Score
return highestScore
End Algorithm

Algorithm findLowestScore(scores)
Assuming the first score is the lowest score
Scores will be iterated
f in each iteration, the current score is less than the previous one, then the current score is the lowest score
Output print Lowest Score
