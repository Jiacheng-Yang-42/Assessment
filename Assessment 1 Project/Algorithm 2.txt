Algorithm calculateMean(scores)
Assuming the initial value of the sum is 0
Scores will be iterated
Add up all the scores
The mean is equal to the sum of the scores divided by the length of the scores
Output print mean
return mean
End Algorithm

Algorithm calculateStandardDeviation(scores, mean)
Assuming the initial value of the sum of squared differences is 0.
Scores will be iterated
Difference is equal to the score minus the mean
Sum of squared differences equals difference multiplied difference
Calculate the sum of squared differences divided by the number of scores.
calculate the square root of the sum of squared differences divided by the number of scores.
Output print StandardDeviation
return standardDeviation
End Algorithm
